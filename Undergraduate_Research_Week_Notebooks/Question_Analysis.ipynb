They ration the people for, you know, for winter, you know, for the-- with coal, you know. We got rationing. This what I've been working in. And the coal would come, and we'd have to unload it. They make some factories, like for the-- all is for the Germans, you know? And Khaim und Kowski had been the Altere.\\nINTERVIEWER: Mrs. Goodman, what happened to you in 1939?\\nSUBJECT: In 1939, when the German came into Poland, into Sokol\\ufffd\\ufffdw, it was pretty bad. But I was a child, and I didn't realize what I-- what I realize now. Like I said before, we are 10 children. And they stayed for a while, and then the Russian came in to Sokol\\ufffd\\ufffdw.\\nINTERVIEWER: That was the name of the town?\\nSUBJECT: Sokol\\ufffd\\ufffdw.\\nINTERVIEWER: Sokol\\ufffd\\ufffdw.\\nSUBJECT: And because Russia made a pact with Germany, If I remember. I've forgotten a lot of things I don't remember anymore. And they came in. And it was the same thing when the Russian came into us and the Germans came in.\\nSUBJECT: Because the Russians did the same thing-- not exactly the same thing what the Germans did, but they took away all the business from the people. They send a lot of people of Siberia. And it was everything rationed and wasn't too good.\\nINTERVIEWER: What happened to you?\\nSUBJECT: To me, it happened when the Germans came back. They attacked, again, the Russians-- the second time. Poland was taken three times, Sokol\\ufffd\\ufffdw-- one time for the Germans, one time for the Russians, and a third time from the Germans?\\n\",\n          \"SUBJECT: Yes, I think that, uh, undoubtedly accelerated the death of many. And also the fact they couldn't all really be in those buildings. Toward the end, they couldn't all get in. They sort of had to take turns being inside. And, uh, yes, if you were there in November, well, you know that it gets, uh, cold, and then there's a little snow around. And, uh, um, there, uh, the prisoners had obviously greatly, uh, lessened, uh, resistance to infection as they were dying and, uh, were very susceptible, particularly to pneumonia.\\nINTERVIEWER: I've never heard this before, Dr. Clement, and this is, uh, one of the unique things of our project, the statements like you just make, uh, or reveal to us that they took turns to be in the barracks?\\nSUBJECT: This is what I understood, yeah. Well, they were terribly overcrowded, you know. It was, uh, at least three or four-fold what they had, uh, been designed for. And they had been designed for very crowded living, just, uh, body to body.\\nINTERVIEWER: How many people would you say that you saw in one barrack? What were-- what did you see in terms of crowded conditions?\\nSUBJECT: Well, uh, of course we got there at-- 10 days after the camp had fallen, uh, eight days after the war ended. And, uh, they were still very crowded in these bunks. Um, and a lot of them, of course, were-- pretty much had to be fed there. They were really a lot of them, just too weak to walk. Uh, by that time, uh, some of the worst, uh, cases, uh, probably had been weeded out. But crowding and filth, of course, remained a tremendous problem.\\nSUBJECT: I spent, uh-- once we'd done that quick walk-through and selected our patients, well, I spent, uh, all my time really in this research ward we had set up, a 60-bed ward. And, uh, but I certainly had a great sense of the filth and crowding and-- and just inadequate, uh, air for everybody. And of course, you can imagine the sten-- stench of those barracks.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chain_of_thought\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16494,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The pronoun \\\"they\\\" in the question likely refers to \\\"the average person\\\" mentioned in the Interviewer's previous statement.

I really can see why.\\nSUBJECT: It's a very difficult question.\\nINTERVIEWER: Israel?\\nSUBJECT: I love Israel. I feel that if I want to be really safe, I should be there.

Always something would happen-- the electricity would break down or something would happen. She never told me. This lady friend of hers told me about it. She never told me.\\nINTERVIEWER: What kind of experiments were they going to do?\\nSUBJECT: Well, they were trying-- with women complication, with women diseases, with women-- they were tyring-- my mother was very young. My mother was only 30 years old. And she was a beautiful woman. She still is. And that is-- how a person can see so much and be still happy sometimes-- she has sad eyes. And she's not in good health, of course. But how can a person like that go back to life after seeing such horrors has always been very intriguing to me. And she made very nicely, I must say, the adjustment.\\nINTERVIEWER: That's why you say it's a miracle that she had a child?\\nSUBJECT: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.\\nINTERVIEWER: But they never did do--\\nSUBJECT: Oh, no, she never was touched. She was just on the table ready to be touched when something happened-- four times.\\n\",\n          \"INTERVIEWER: Did the people in Hungary believe that-- they knew about the war, I'm sure.\\nSUBJECT: Oh, yeah.

Yeah.\\nINTERVIEWER: So I guess those people, even who had a chance to leave, just didn't leave?\\nSUBJECT: They didn't leave.\\nINTERVIEWER: Do you think it was mistaken?\\nSUBJECT: It was a mistake.\\nSUBJECT: The mistake was making our people in Romania that were in our committee-- the committee no will tell you for the Jewish people to listen. You go up Auschwitz, we know it. You go up Auschwitz, you will be killed. Go do what you can, you know?\\nINTERVIEWER: They didn't say that?\\nSUBJECT: No say nothing that they would take to work, that's all they say.

Everybody was knowing who was gone--\\nSUBJECT: Something-- something happened to them. Because so many people can't go just-- just to work. They have plenty people in Germany. Why they want to take Hungarian people or Polish people or any other kind of nationality people to work in Germany? And it's unbelievable that the very, very first and the very last when we went out, we didn't even know what will really happened to us.\\n\",\n          \"SUBJECT: Well, eh, after six months being in Treblinka, they, uh, selected me, uh, to go to another concentration camp.
